For me:
- Re-order fields

compulsory: name, addgene_id, category
optional: well, resistance, type, description

(rename type to category)

- Download addgene page as html -> only html
- Get data from Addgene using web app
- Get extra fields from paper 
	- https://www.adobe.com/uk/acrobat/online/pdf-to-excel.html
	- incognito mode
- Join table? =VLOOKUP(B2,extra_info!A:B,2,FALSE)
- Put them in excel and do join if necessary
- 


- delete entry vector and cassette only after unique columns are seen
